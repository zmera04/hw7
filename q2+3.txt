2. What are some examples of how PHP and JavaScript are alike and how they differ?
    Javascript and PHP are similar because they are both used (together) to create dynamic, user-tailored websites. Both
    languages are object oriented, and used to send and request data to a server/database. Both languages have loosely-typed
    variables, which means that variable types do not need to be explicitly declared. Both languages support logic,
    arithmetic, conditionals, scope, functions, and objects. Javascript is different from PHP because Javascript processes
    scripts on the user’s computer, or the ‘front end.’ PHP, unlike Javascript, processes scripts on the server, or the
    ‘back end.’

3. Define MVC, what are the responsibilities of each piece?
    MVC; or Model, View, Controller; is an architectural and design pattern that separates applications into three main
    logical components. Each component, or logical layer, is built to handle specific aspects of an application. The Model
    component is concerned with all the data-related logic that the user works with. The model interacts with the database
    and gives the required data back to the controller. The View component generates a user interface, concerning itself
    with all of the UI logic of an application. Views are generated via interacts with the controller, to use data
    collected by the model. The Controller serves as an intermediary between the Model and the View. The Controller does not
    handle data logic, simply instructing the model. It processes incoming requests, manipulates data using the Model, and 
    interacts with the View to render the UI.
